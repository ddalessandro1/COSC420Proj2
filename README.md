# COSC420Proj2
# This project is the serial version of a non-MCS where 
# the areas of many randomly generated inscribed triangles 
# are determined using geometric, trigonometric and algebraic relationships.
# This is also meant to exemplify the usefullness of a make file when
# using a user-generated static library. 

# Just use the makefile
